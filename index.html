    <h1> My first Personal Website!</h1>
    <p>My journey into writing code started 
    some few weeks back with <a href="http://www.google.com"> the magnificient</a>Code Institute.
     After some weeks to that experience it will 
     look like I am <em>more experience</em> in 
     writing code, hence "My First Personal Website
     ".</p>

     <h2> My Journey So Far.</h2>
     <p> Today, I am taking a quatum leap <a href="pagetwo.html">page two</a>by 
    trying my hands on creating a website to 
    tell my story. I hope this inspires you 
    to start your journey too: remember that 
    <strong>"A journey of <em>thousand miles begins with a step".</em></strong>     Goodluck!</p>
